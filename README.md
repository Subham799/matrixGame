# Pattern Memory Game

A challenging and fun Pattern Memory Game where players must memorize and repeat a sequence of highlighted cells on a grid. The game increases in difficulty with each level, featuring larger grids and longer patterns. Built to enhance my JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills, this project showcases my ability to create interactive web applications.

## About the Project
The Pattern Memory Game tests your memory by displaying a random pattern of highlighted cells on a grid. Players must click the cells in the correct order to match the pattern. With each successful round, the game progresses to a higher level with a larger grid and longer pattern. Features include score tracking, high score saving, sound effects, and a responsive design.
